      <p>The honey badgers have a fairly long body, but a distinctly thickset broad shoulders, and, you know, their skin is loose, allowing them to move about  freely, and they twist around. Now look: Here's a house full of bees. Do you think the honey badger cares? It doesn't give a crap, it goes right into the house of bees to get some larvae. How disgusting is that? It eats larvae. Eew, that's so nasty.</a></p>
